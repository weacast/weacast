This is not a reflection of you as an engineer or a person. Please accept feedback graciously as we will also try to be sensitive when providing it.</p><p>Although we generally accept many PRs they can be rejected for many reasons. We will be as transparent as possible but it may simply be that you do not have the same context or information regarding the roadmap that the core team members have. We value the time you take to put together any contributions so we pledge to always be respectful of that time and will try to be as open as possible so that you don&#39;t waste it.</p><h3 id="contributor-code-of-conduct" tabindex="-1">Contributor Code of Conduct <a class="header-anchor" href="#contributor-code-of-conduct" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Contributor Code of Conduct&quot;">​</a></h3><p>As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.</p><p>We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.</p><p>Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.</p><p>Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.
