# Architecture

Before jumping to the [global architecture view](./global-architecture.md) we recommend to read about the [main concepts](./main-concepts.md) and the [domain model](./domain-model.md) of Weacast. 

You can then have a look to:
* the [component-oriented view](./component-view.md) of the architecture
* the [data model-oriented view](./data-model-view.md) of the architecture
* the [dynamic view](./dynamic-view.md) of the architecture
